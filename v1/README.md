# Webpack example v1

This simple webpack example shows how a very basic bundle works, it takes one component and compiles a bundle.

- component1.js is the base component that will be bundled
- index.html is the page that uses the bundle

##How to Run
Navigate to /v1 and on the console (alternatively you can run _run.sh_):
    
    >webpack ./component1.js compiled/bundle.js
